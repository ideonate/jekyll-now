description:
  Designed and built a control system allowing human operators to manage a robotic production pipeline. <br/><br/>
  Ideonate's key insight was that the robots in this setup were reasonably predictable - the software needed to manage the humans' workflow as much as the robots.
  <br/><br/>
  Led build and deployment of live system for the first phase of this startup company's growth, all on time and within estimated budgets.
