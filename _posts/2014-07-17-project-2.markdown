description:
  Helped non-technical founding team understand the role that technology can play in their businesses.
  <br/><br/>
  While competitive pressures caused the founders to focus on technology in their marketing, I persuaded them to focus instead on their core strengths - psychology and marketing.
  <br/><br/>
  Meanwhile, I helped build interactive demos to bring their psychological models to life, and helped select off-the-shelf software to deliver the first version of their product.
